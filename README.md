# Madule_6_Challenge_python-API

#The training material provided last week has thoroughly covered most of the code. However, there was a #few key points I'd like to elaborate on, their sources:


#1-Official Documentation: The panda's official documentation-https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ 

#2-DataCamp

#3-YouTube Tutorials: Numerous YouTube channels offer free pandas tutorials.

#4-Kaggle: They offer free tutorials and notebooks that cover various topics.

#5- Chat GPT: Helps with fault finding and debugging


Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship-After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modelling. Describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may uncover.

#1-Temperature vs. Latitude

# 1-1) The relation between Northern Hemisphere city max Temperature (C) vs. Latitude is: y = -0.29x + 33.96 (rvalue = -0.68)
# The negative correlation in the Northern Hemisphere means that you will likely encounter cooler temperatures as you move farther away from the equator (higher latitudes).

# 1-2) The relation between Southern Hemisphere city max Temperature (C) vs. Latitude is: y = 0.56x + 31.26 (rvalue = 0.84)
# The positive correlation in the Southern Hemisphere indicates that temperatures tend to become warmer as you move closer to the equator (lower latitudes)


# An r value of -0.68 and 0.84 indicates moderate and strong correlations, respectively. A value closer to -1 or 1 indicates a stronger linear relationship. 
# However, the models are also based on random city data analysis and may not predict exact temperature values in every scenario. They offer a simplified 
# representation of the general trend between latitude and temperature.



#2-Humidity vs. Latitude

# 2-1) The relation between Northern Hemisphere city Humidity (%) vs. Latitude is: y = 0.11x + 65 (rvalue = 0.08)

# 2-2) The relation between Southern Hemisphere city Humidity (%) vs. Latitude is: y = -0.07x + 62.97 (rvalue = -0.04)

# Both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the relationship between humidity and latitude appears very weak based on the low r-values.
# While you've observed some relationships between humidity and latitude, the low R-values and small slopes suggest 
# that latitude might not be a significant predictor of humidity on its own.
# Other variables are likely at play, and further analysis or consideration of additional factors could provide more insights.
# This means that latitude alone is not a strong predictor of humidity.
# The slopes of the regression lines are very close to zero, 
# which reinforces the idea that the changes in humidity are relatively minor as latitude changes



#3-Cloudiness vs. Latitude

# 3-1) The relation between Northern Hemisphere city Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude is: y = 0.21x + 51.63 (rvalue = 0.11)

# 3-2) The relation between Southern Hemisphere city Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude is: y = 0.04x + 48.24 (rvalue = 0.01)
# The relationship between cloudiness and latitude appears weak in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, as indicated by the low R-values.
# The positive slopes of the regression lines suggest that there's a tendency for cloudiness to increase with increasing latitude, but the magnitude of the effect is small.
# Various complex atmospheric and meteorological factors influence cloudiness, including local weather patterns, wind patterns, and geographical features. These factors might contribute to the weak relationships observed here.
# In summary, the weak relationships between cloudiness and latitude in both hemispheres and the low R-values indicate that latitude alone might not strongly predict cloudiness. Other factors likely play a significant role 
# in determining cloudiness levels in a given location. Further investigation and consideration of additional variables could provide more insights.


#4-Wind Speed(m/s) vs. Latitude

# 4-1) The relation between Northern Hemisphere city Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude is: y = -0.01x + 3.87 (rvalue = -0.06)

# 4-2) The relation between Southern Hemisphere city Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude is: y = -0.03x + 3.58 (rvalue = -0.15)
# The relationships between wind speed and latitude in both hemispheres are weak, as indicated by the low r-values.
# The negative slopes in both cases suggest that wind speed decreases as you move away from the equator, regardless of hemisphere.
# While latitude does play a role in wind speed patterns, it is not the sole determinant. Local topography, weather systems, ocean currents, and 
# atmospheric conditions all contribute to the variability in wind speed.
# In summary, while there is a negative trend between wind speed and latitude, the weak correlations suggest that latitude is not a strong 
# predictor of wind speed. Many complex factors influence wind speed, and further investigation into local meteorological conditions 
# is necessary to fully understand wind speed patterns.
