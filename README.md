# Madule_6_Challenge_python-API

#The training material provided last week has thoroughly covered most of the code. However, there was a #few key points I'd like to elaborate on, their sources:


#1-Official Documentation: The panda's official documentation-https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ 

#2-DataCamp

#3-YouTube Tutorials: Numerous YouTube channels offer free pandas tutorials.

#4-Kaggle: They offer free tutorials and notebooks that cover various topics.

#5- Chat GPT: Helps with fault finding and debugging


Requirement 2: Compute Linear Regression for Each Relationship-After each pair of plots, explain what the linear regression is modelling. Describe any relationships that you notice and any other findings you may uncover.

1-Temperature vs. Latitude

1-1) The relation between Northern Hemisphere city max Temperature (C) vs. Latitude is: y = -0.29x + 33.96 (rvalue = -0.68)
The negative correlation in the Northern Hemisphere means that you will likely encounter cooler temperatures as you move farther away from the equator (higher latitudes).

1-2) The relation between Southern Hemisphere city max Temperature (C) vs. Latitude is: y = 0.56x + 31.26 (rvalue = 0.84)
The positive correlation in the Southern Hemisphere indicates that temperatures tend to become warmer as you move closer to the equator (lower latitudes)


An r value of -0.68 and 0.84 indicates moderate and strong correlations, respectively. A value closer to -1 or 1 indicates a stronger linear relationship. however, the models are also based on random city data analysis and may not predict exact temperature values in every scenario. They offer a simplified representation of the general trend between latitude and temperature.
